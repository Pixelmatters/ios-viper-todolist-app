# Todolist App + VIPER

This app will be used to showcase the usage of VIPER on a simple Todolist App.
In the app you will be capable of:

- Creating todos;
- Checking and unchecking todos;
- Deleting todos.

In order to persist the information between sessions, [CoreData](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata) was used.

As an extra bonus, Unit Test were also added in order to show how to apply them in a VIPER project.
